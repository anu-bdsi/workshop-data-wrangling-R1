  abstract = {The relatively new partial least squares (PLS) regression method is used to relate yearly differences in straw length of 15 barley genotypes to climatic variations over 9 years. After main effects of genoty and years were removed by conventional two-way ANOVA, the residual table of genotype x year interactions was related to a table of rainfall, temperature, and global radiation at different stages throughout the growth season, over the 9 years. In contrast to ANOVA interaction analysis based on principal component analysis, the related PLS regression method gave a direct, parsimonious linear modelling of the systematic relationships between the two tables in one single estimation procedure. Two main factors were found. The first one related warm, dry weather during the ear emergence to higher straw lengths in 6-row barleys than in 2-row barleys. The second factor related climatic differences between the first and last part of the growing season to straw length variations in certain related 2-row barley genotypes.},
